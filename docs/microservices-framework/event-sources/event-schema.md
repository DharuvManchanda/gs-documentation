# Event Schema

An event schema defines the structured format or blueprint for representing data within an event. It outlines the specific fields, data types, and structure that an event must adhere to. The schema serves as a standardized template, ensuring consistency in the project

### Request Schema

Sample spec for request schema.
```yaml
http.get./greet: #The initial line depicts a fusion of the event, the employed method, and the path associated with the event.
  fn: function_greet #The 'fn' key receives the function name located in 'src/functions' and forwards the accompanying parameters.
  params: #It is also possible to define inputs such as 'params,' 'body,' 'headers,' and 'query parameters.'
    - name: greet_message
      in: query
      required: true
  body:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            name: 
              type: string
```
- Furthermore, you have an option to specify responses, including status codes and response body types, among other things.


### Response Schema
Sample spec for response schema.
```yaml
"http.get./helloworld":
  fn: helloworld
  body:
    type: object
    properties:

        type: string
  responses:
