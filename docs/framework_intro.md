# Introduction
Every microservice in the Godspeed framework has three fundamental abstractions, and the developer needs to work with just these three.

## Guiding principles of design
### Three fundamental abstractions
Every microservice in the Godspeed framework has three fundamental abstractions, and the developer needs to work with just these three.
- **Event-sources:** In the Godspeed framework, Event Sources serve as a mechanism for defining the primary entry or initiation points of an application. For instance, you can opt for an 'express' type of Event Source to expose your application through REST APIs, or you may choose a 'cron' type Event Source to schedule recurring calls to specific workflows. This level of configurability empowers developers to finely tune the behavior of their application according to their requirements.

  - **Events:** Events trigger workflows. Events are generated by event sources like REST endpoints, gRPC, message bus, webhooks, websockets, S3, and more...

- **Workflows:** Workflows are triggered by events. They not only perform business logic but also provide orchestration over datasources and microservices, and data/API federation. They will use datasources to store or retrieve data, join across various datasources, transform data, emit events and send responses. The framework provides a YAML dsl with some inbuilt workflows. If YAML does not suffice for any particular case, developers can currently put JS/TS workflows alongside YAML workflows and use them. Coming in future: Support for other languages.

- **Datasources:** Datasources are locations where data can be stored or read from. For example API datasource (another microservice or third party), datastores (RDBMS, document, key-value), file system, S3 storage, etc. A microservice can use multiple datasources. The framework provides abstractions for Authn/Authz making it easy for the developer to express the same in a low code manner.
