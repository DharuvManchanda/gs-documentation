# Overview

  Event sources in Godspeed framework captures event and allows you to define entry or trigger points of application. Like `express` type, event source will allow you to expose your application through REST API or a `cron` type event source to schedule a recurring call to a workflow.

## Types of Event Sources
  1. Event Source
    - it can act only as an event source
    - has its own client initilization
    - eg,. express
  2. DataSource As an Event Source
    - it can act as event source as well as data source
    - shares the client with the corresponding data source
    - eg., kafka, rabbitMQ

**Here kafka works as datasource and an eventsource. To have look at the configuration, events and workflows, Checkout [Kafka](https://github.com/godspeedsystems/gs-plugins/tree/main/plugins/kafka-as-datasource-as-eventsource#godspeed-plugin-kafka-as-datasource-as-eventsource)**
